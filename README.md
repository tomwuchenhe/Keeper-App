APIs: Follow restfulAPI structure and having all get, delete, patch, post request writtern using axios.

Other: use reactRouter to route to different components

Note: Inspired by Dr.Angela Yu for FRONT-END STYLING ONLY, added way more features and animation for front-end.

back-end: Using Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL to build a backend, passport and express-session also used to maintain user login credentials, used hashing and salting to 
encrypt user data and basic CRUD action. Used passport to only keep authorized user into home page. User can only see their notes by authentication process and login.

Still have a lot to improve, feel free to add more features and optimize the code.
